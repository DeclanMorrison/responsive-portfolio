        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; I don't like generic Lorem Ipsum filler text, so here is the transcript of my favorite The Office episode,
            Fun Run.</p>

        <br>

        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Okay. Well I did not get the job in New-York. But I got the real prize domestic bliss. Jan made me
            breakfast this morning. Well, she bought the milk. It's soy. This is why I do it. That's what I have to come
            home to. She probably won't be up for a few hours. This is going be a very good year. Very good. Jan is at home.
            Jim is back. My protégé Ryan is at corporate. Good stuff. Andy and Dwight are rocking the sales team. I feel
            very blessed.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Generally it's not a good idea to click on any internet offers that you haven't requested. What was
            the exact offer? It was for a video. Yeah, well, what kind of video? A cebrity sex tape. Really? What kind of
            celebrity? - Not relevant. - How much you paid for it? - You paid for it? - It all happened so fast! I broke
            up with Karen after the job interview. And, uh It was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She
            told me very clearly that just because we were broken up doesn't mean that she was going anywhere, because she
            had worked really hard for her career. But the next day, her desk was empty. And as for me and my current romantic
            life I, uh I'm single now and looking. So if you know anybody Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got
            back from New York. I talked him through his breakup. It's really nice to be good friends again.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Are you kidding me? Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile. They're just keeping
            it a secret. Right? I don't know. There is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. Could
            other things. Are you kidding me? And sunday, I'm thinking of going to that flea market at the drive-in. Oh,
            that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on sunday in montage mountain. - Cool. - Yeah. Well, have fun with that.
            Ladies and gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car. - What? - Where? It happened this morning
            in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital. And the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that
            they could. And she is going to be okay. What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that? - So
            she's really going to be fine? - Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture. But people have survived far worse.
            Thank God you were there. Yeah. Did you see who did it? No need. We can just check the security tapes. Yeah,
            kind of a good news/bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit
            her. Who was driving? Oh, Michael. One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder
            who he ran over then.
